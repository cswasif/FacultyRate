# FacultyRate

A private, privacy-focused faculty rating system that uses AI to analyze student feedback while maintaining student confidentiality.

## Features

- üîí Privacy-First: All student information is automatically redacted
- ü§ñ AI-Powered Analysis: Uses Google's Gemini AI for intelligent feedback analysis
- üìä Comprehensive Rating System: Evaluates teaching effectiveness, student engagement, clarity, and professionalism
- üñºÔ∏è Image Processing: Supports feedback submission through text and images using Gemini Vision AI
- üåê RESTful API: Complete API for managing faculty and reviews
- üéØ Course-Specific Reviews: Support for course-specific faculty evaluations

## System Architecture

The system consists of two main components:
1. Main Application Server (`app.py`): Handles user interface and AI analysis
2. API Server (`api.py`): Manages data storage and retrieval

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Google Gemini API Key
- SQLite3

### Installation

1. Clone the repository (requires access):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FacultyRate-Private.git
cd FacultyRate-Private
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your Google API key
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the API server:
```bash
python api.py
```

2. In a new terminal, start the main application:
```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be available at:
- Main Application: http://localhost:5000
- API Server: http://localhost:5001
